## 2. Search section  
- In the "Search" section, everything is same as the "Diagnose" section's, except for the similar image search function.  
- First, you need to be connected to your own XNAT(PACS) to use this function.
- To search your specific image, show it on your screen using the seek bar.  
- Then, press the "IMAGE SEARCH" button.
- In a moment, the result will be retrieved as the following screenshot.
