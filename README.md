- If you want to view your DICOM files, select the "Diagnose" button.  
- If you want to search the image similar with yours, select the "Search" button.

## Diagnose section  
- In the "Diagnose" section, you can view your series of DICOM files with a seek bar.  
- You can change window center by scrolling up and down and window level by scrolling left and right.  
- Also, you can zoom it in and out with panning.

## Search section  
- In the "Search" section, everything is same as the "Diagnose" section's, except for the similar image search function.  
- First, you need to be connected to your own XNAT(PACS) to use this function.
- To search your specific image, show it on your screen using the seek bar.  
- Then, press the "IMAGE SEARCH" button.
- In a moment, the result will be retrieved as the following screenshot.
